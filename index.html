                <h2>What I think about learning Soft Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    At this point I've learned that is really important 
                    to have as many skills as you can. In the past I used to look for 
                    a conventional education, what is infact inportant, but the 
                    enlargement and increasing role of <strong>soft skills</strong> 
                    to the business environment, becoming one of the most important axis of 
                    talent carrear based.

                <h3>Funny stories about euphoria and its efect</h2>
                <p>
                    In my first interaction with the camera in the classroom, I started 
                    talking so fast, that people didn't understand anything about the message, 
                    because I was euphoric. Its good to learn again, because we live for it.
